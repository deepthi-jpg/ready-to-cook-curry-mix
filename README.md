# Development of Ready-to-Cook Curry Mix Enriched with Vegetable Protein
This repository documents a research project focused on the development of a
ready-to-cook vegetable curry mix enriched with vegetable protein using
defatted sesame meal and dehydrated vegetables.

## Publication Details
- Journal: The Pharma Innovation Journal
- Year: 2023
- Author: S. Pavana Deepthi

## Objective
To develop a nutritious ready-to-cook curry mix enriched with vegetable protein
and to evaluate its physico-chemical, sensory, microbial and shelf-life properties.

## Raw Materials Used
- Defatted sesame oil cake
- Dehydrated vegetables (carrot, capsicum, tomato, onion)
- Spices and herbs
- Rice flour and black gram flour

## Processing Steps
- Blanching and dehydration of vegetables
- Preparation of spice powders
- Roasting and processing of sesame meal
- Formulation and blending of curry mix
- Packaging in LDPE pouches

## Parameters Analyzed
- Moisture content
- pH and total soluble solids
- Protein, fat, carbohydrates and ash
- Energy value
- Sensory evaluation (9-point hedonic scale)
- Microbial analysis and shelf life

## Key Results
- Protein content ranged from 23–27%
- Moisture content below 3%
- High sensory acceptability
- Shelf life up to 3 months without preservatives

## Conclusion
The developed ready-to-cook curry mix is nutritionally rich, safe, shelf-stable
and suitable for convenience food applications.
